A KEM can be transformed into an unrestricted\n PKE using HPKE (RFC9180). On its own, a KEM can be used as a key\n agreement method in TLS.\n\n Kyber is an IND-CCA2 secure KEM. It is constructed by applying a\n Fujisaki--Okamato style transformation on InnerPKE, which is the\n underlying IND-CPA secure Public Key Encryption scheme. We cannot\n use InnerPKE directly, as its ciphertexts are malleable.\n\n ```\n                     F.O. transform\n     InnerPKE   ---------------------->   Kyber\n     IND-CPA                              IND-CCA2\n ```\n\n Kyber is a lattice-based scheme.  More precisely, its security is\n based on the learning-with-errors-and-rounding problem in module\n lattices (MLWER).  The underlying polynomial ring R (defined in\n Section 5) is chosen such that multiplication is very fast using the\n number theoretic transform (NTT, see Section 5.1.3).\n\n An InnerPKE private key is a vector _s_ over R of length k which is\n _small_ in a particular way.  Here k is a security parameter akin to\n the size of a prime modulus.  For Kyber512, which targets AES-128's\n security level, the value of k is 2.\n\n The public key consists of two values:\n\n * _A_ a uniformly sampled k by k matrix over R _and_\n\n * _t = A s + e_, where e is a suitably small masking vector.\n\n Distinguishing between such A s + e and a uniformly sampled t is the\n module learning-with-errors (MLWE) problem.  If that is hard, then it\n is also hard to recover the private key from the public key as that\n would allow you to distinguish between those two.\n\n To save space in the public key, A is recomputed deterministically\n from a seed _rho_.\n\n A ciphertext for a message m under this public key is a pair (c_1,\n c_2) computed roughly as follows:\n\n c_1 = Compress(A^T r + e_1, d_u)\n c_2 = Compress(t^T r + e_2 + Decompress(m, 1), d_v)\n\n where\n\n * e_1, e_2 and r are small blinds;\n\n * Compress(-, d) removes some information, leaving d bits per\n   coefficient and Decompress is such that Compress after Decompress\n   does nothing and\n\n * d_u, d_v are scheme parameters.\n\n Distinguishing such a ciphertext and uniformly sampled (c_1, c_2) is\n an example of the full MLWER problem, see section 4.4 of [KyberV302].\n\n To decrypt the ciphertext, one computes\n\n m = Compress(Decompress(c_2, d_v) - s^T Decompress(c_1, d_u), 1).\n\n It it not straight-forward to see that this formula is correct.  In\n fact, there is negligible but non-zero probability that a ciphertext\n does not decrypt correctly given by the DFP column in Table 4.  This\n failure probability can be computed by a careful automated analysis\n of the probabilities involved, see kyber_failure.py of [SecEst].\n\n [KyberV302](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/data/kyber-specification-round3-20210804.pdf)\n [I-D](https://github.com/bwesterb/draft-schwabe-cfrg-kyber)\n [SecEst](https://github.com/pq-crystals/security-estimates)\n",[],false],[131,104,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,105,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,107,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,108,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,109,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,110,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,111,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,112,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,113,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,116,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,119,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,122,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,125,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,127,0,null,null,null,[16552,16553,16554,16555,16556],false],[131,127,0,null,null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"name",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"k",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"eta1",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"du",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"dv",null,null,null,false],[131,145,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,153,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,161,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,169,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,170,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,171,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,172,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,173,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,175,0,null,null,null,[16566],false],[0,0,0,"p",null,"",[],true],[131,178,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,180,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,181,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,182,0,null,null,null,null,false],[131,185,0,null,null," Length (in bytes) of a shared secret.",null,false],[131,187,0,null,null," Length (in bytes) of a seed for deterministic encapsulation.",null,false],[131,189,0,null,null," Length (in bytes) of a seed for key generation.",null,false],[131,191,0,null,null," Algorithm name.",null,false],[131,194,0,null,null," A shared secret, and an encapsulated (encrypted) representation of it.",[16577,16579],false],[131,194,0,null,null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"shared_secret",null,null,null,false],[131,194,0,null,null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"ciphertext",null,null,null,false],[131,200,0,null,null," A Kyber public key.",[16590,16592],false],[131,207,0,null,null," Size of a serialized representation of the key, in bytes.",null,false],[131,212,0,null,null," Generates a shared secret, and encapsulates it for the public key.\n If `seed` is `null`, a random seed is used.

Renders fmt string with args, calling `writer` with slices of bytes.\n If `writer` returns an error, the error is returned from `format` and\n `writer` is not called again.\n\n The format string must be comptime-known and may contain placeholders following\n this format:\n `{[argument][specifier]:[fill][alignment][width].[precision]}`\n\n Above, each word including its surrounding [ and ] is a parameter which you have to replace with something:\n\n - *argument* is either the numeric index or the field name of the argument that should be inserted\n   - when using a field name, you are required to enclose the field name (an identifier) in square\n     brackets, e.g. {[score]...} as opposed to the numeric index form which can be written e.g. {2...}\n - *specifier* is a type-dependent formatting option that determines how a type should formatted (see below)\n - *fill* is a single character which is used to pad the formatted text\n - *alignment* is one of the three characters `<`, `^`, or `>` to make the text left-, center-, or right-aligned, respectively\n - *width* is the total width of the field in characters\n - *precision* specifies how many decimals a formatted number should have\n\n Note that most of the parameters are optional and may be omitted. Also you can leave out separators like `:` and `.` when\n all parameters after the separator are omitted.\n Only exception is the *fill* parameter. If *fill* is required, one has to specify *alignment* as well, as otherwise\n the digits after `:` is interpreted as *width*, not *fill*.\n\n The *specifier* has several options for types:\n - `x` and `X`: output numeric value in hexadecimal notation\n - `s`:\n   - for pointer-to-many and C pointers of u8, print as a C-string using zero-termination\n   - for slices of u8, print the entire slice as a string without zero-termination\n - `e`: output floating point value in scientific notation\n - `d`: output numeric value in decimal notation\n - `b`: output integer value in binary notation\n - `o`: output integer value in octal notation\n - `c`: output integer as an ASCII character. Integer type must have 8 bits at max.\n - `u`: output integer as an UTF-8 sequence. Integer type must have 21 bits at max.\n - `?`: output optional value as either the unwrapped value, or `null`; may be followed by a format specifier for the underlying value.\n - `!`: output error union value as either the unwrapped value, or the formatted error value; may be followed by a format specifier for the underlying value.\n - `*`: output the address of the value instead of the value itself.\n - `any`: output a value of any type using its default format.\n\n If a formatted user type contains a function of the type\n ```\n pub fn format(value: ?, comptime fmt: []const u8, options: std.fmt.FormatOptions, writer: anytype) !void\n ```\n with `?` being the type formatted, this function will be called instead of the default implementation.\n This allows user types to be formatted in

For small\n    allocations, this is handled here; for larger ones it is handled in the\n    backing allocator (by default `std.heap.page_allocator`).\n\n  * Make pointer math errors unlikely to harm memory from\n    unrelated allocations.\n\n  * It's OK for these mechanisms to cost some extra overhead bytes.\n\n  * It's OK for performance cost for these mechanisms.\n\n  * Rogue memory writes should not harm the allocator's state.\n\n  * Cross platform. Operates based on a backing allocator which makes it work\n    everywhere, even freestanding.\n\n  * Compile-time configuration.\n\n ### `OptimizationMode.release_fast` (note: not much work has gone into this use case yet):\n\n  * Low fragmentation is primary concern\n  * Performance of worst-case latency is secondary concern\n  * Performance of average-case latency is next\n  * Finally, having freed memory unmapped, and pointer math errors unlikely to\n    harm memory from unrelated allocations are nice-to-haves.\n\n ### `OptimizationMode.release_small` (note: not much work has gone into this use case yet):\n\n  * Small binary code size of the executable is the primary concern.\n  * Next, defer to the `.release_fast` priority list.\n\n ## Basic Design:\n\n Small allocations are divided into buckets:\n\n ```\n index obj_size\n 0     1\n 1     2\n 2     4\n 3     8\n 4     16\n 5     32\n 6     64\n 7     128\n 8     256\n 9     512\n 10    1024\n 11    2048\n ```\n\n The main allocator state has an array of all the \"current\" buckets for each\n size class. Each slot in the array can be null, meaning the bucket for that\n size class is not allocated. When the first object is allocated for a given\n size class, it allocates 1 page of memory from the OS. This page is\n divided into \"slots\" - one per allocated object. Along with the page of memory\n for object slots, as many pages as necessary are allocated to store the\n BucketHeader, followed by \"used bits\", and two stack traces for each slot\n (allocation trace and free trace).\n\n The \"used bits\" are 1 bit per slot representing whether the slot is used.\n Allocations use the data to iterate to find a free slot. Frees assert that the\n corresponding bit is 1 and set it to 0.\n\n Buckets have prev and next pointers. When there is only one bucket for a given\n size class, both prev and next point to itself. When all slots of a bucket are\n used, a new bucket is allocated, and enters the doubly linked list. The main\n allocator state tracks the \"current\" bucket for each size class. Leak detection\n currently only checks the current bucket.\n\n Resizing detects if the size class is unchanged or smaller, in which case the same\n pointer is returned unmodified.

API bits for the Secure Computing facility in the Linux kernel, which allows\n processes to restrict access to the system call API.\n\n Seccomp started life with a single \"strict\" mode, which only allowed calls\n to read(2), write(2), _exit(2) and sigreturn(2). It turns out that this\n isn't that useful for general-purpose applications, and so a mode that\n utilizes user-supplied filters mode was added.\n\n Seccomp filters are classic BPF programs. Conceptually, a seccomp program\n is attached to the kernel and is executed on each syscall. The \"packet\"\n being validated is the `data` structure, and the verdict is an action that\n the kernel performs on the calling process. The actions are variations on a\n \"pass\" or \"fail\" result, where a pass allows the syscall to continue and a\n fail blocks the syscall and returns some sort of error value. See the full\n list of actions under ::RET for more information. Finally, only word-sized,\n absolute loads (`ld [k]`) are supported to read from the `data` structure.\n\n There are some issues with the filter API that have traditionally made\n writing them a pain:\n\n 1. Each CPU architecture supported by Linux has its own unique ABI and\n    syscall API. It is not guaranteed that the syscall numbers and arguments\n    are the same across architectures, or that they're even implemented. Thus,\n    filters cannot be assumed to be portable without consulting documentation\n    like syscalls(2) and testing on target hardware. This also requires\n    checking the value of `data.arch` to make sure that a filter was compiled\n    for the correct architecture.\n 2. Many syscalls take an `unsigned long` or `size_t` argument, the size of\n    which is dependant on the ABI. Since BPF programs execute in a 32-bit\n    machine, validation of 64-bit arguments necessitates two load-and-compare\n    instructions for the upper and lower words.\n 3. A further wrinkle to the above is endianness. Unlike network packets,\n    syscall data shares the endianness of the target machine. A filter\n    compiled on a little-endian machine will not work on a big-endian one,\n    and vice-versa. For example: Checking the upper 32-bits of `data.arg1`\n    requires a load at `@offsetOf(data, \"arg1\") + 4` on big-endian systems\n    and `@offsetOf(data, \"arg1\")` on little-endian systems. Endian-portable\n    filters require adjusting these offsets at compile time, similar to how\n    e.g. OpenSSH does[1].\n 4. Syscalls with userspace implementations via the vDSO cannot be traced or\n    filtered. The vDSO can be disabled or just ignored, which must be taken\n    into account when writing filters.\n 5. Software libraries -  especially dynamically loaded ones - tend to use\n    more of the syscall API over time, thus filters must evolve with them.\n    Static filters can result in reduced or even broken functionality when\n    calling newer code from these libraries. This is known to happen with\n    critical libraries like glibc[2].\n\n Some of these issues can be mitigated with help from Zig and the standard\n library. Since the target CPU is known at compile time, the proper syscall\n numbers are mixed into the `os` namespace under `std.os.SYS (see the code\n for `arch_bits` in `os/linux.zig`). Referencing an unimplemented syscall\n would be a compile error. Endian offsets can also be defined in a similar\n manner to the OpenSSH example:\n\n ```zig\n const offset = if (native_endian == .little) struct {\n     pub const low = 0;\n     pub const high = @sizeOf(u32);\n } else struct {\n     pub const low = @sizeOf(u32);\n     pub const high = 0;\n };\n ```\n\n Unfortunately, there is no easy solution for issue 5. The most reliable\n strategy is to keep testing; test newer Zig versions, different libcs,\n different distros, and design your filter to accommodate all of them.\n Alternatively, you could inject a filter at runtime. Since filters are\n preserved across execve(2), a filter could be setup before executing your\n program, without your program having any knowledge of this happening. This\n is the method used by systemd[3] and Cloudflare's sandbox library[4].\n\n [1]: https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/sandbox-seccomp-filter.c#L81\n [2]: https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-11/msg00246.html\n [3]: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#SystemCallFilter=\n [4]: https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox\n\n See Also\n - seccomp(2), seccomp_unotify(2)\n - https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html\n",[],false],[360,81,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,84,0,null,null,null,[],false],[360,86,0,null,null," Seccomp not in use.",null,false],[360,88,0,null,null," Uses a hard-coded filter.",null,false],[360,90,0,null,null," Uses a user-supplied filter.",null,false],[360,94,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,95,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,96,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,97,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,100,0,null,null," Bitflags for the SET_MODE_FILTER operation.",[],false],[360,101,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,102,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,103,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,104,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,105,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,111,0,null,null," Action values for seccomp BPF programs.\n The lower 16-bits are for optional return data.\n The upper 16-bits are ordered from least permissive values to most.",[],false],[360,113,0,null,null," Kill the process.",null,false],[360,115,0,null,null," Kill the thread.",null,false],[360,116,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,118,0,null,null," Disallow and force a SIGSYS.",null,false],[360,120,0,null,null," Return an errno.",null,false],[360,122,0,null,null," Forward the syscall to a userspace supervisor to make a decision.",null,false],[360,124,0,null,null," Pass to a tracer or disallow.",null,false],[360,126,0,null,null," Allow after logging.",null,false],[360,128,0,null,null," Allow.",null,false],[360,131,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,132,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,133,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,136,0,null,null,null,[],false],[360,137,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,138,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,139,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,140,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,144,0,null,null," Tells the kernel that the supervisor allows the syscall to continue.",null,false],[360,147,0,null,null," See seccomp_unotify(2).",[],false],[360,148,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,149,0,null,null,null,null,false],[360,152,0,null,null,null,[37160,37161,37162,37163,37164,37165,37166,37167,37168],false],[0,0,0,"nr",null," The system call number.",null,false],[0,0,0,"arch",null," The CPU architecture/system call convention.\n One of the values defined in `std.os.linux.AUDIT`.",null,false],[0,0,0,"instruction_pointer",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg0",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg1",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg2",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg3",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg4",null,null,null,false],[0,0,0,"arg5",null,null,null,false],[360,169,0,null,null," Used with the ::GET_NOTIF_SIZES command to check if the kernel structures\n have changed.",[37170,37171,37172],false],[0,0,0,"notif",null," Size of ::notif.",null,false],[0,0,0,"notif_resp",null," Size of ::resp.",null,false],[0,0,0,"data",null," Size of ::data.",null,false],[360,178,0,null,null,null,[37174,37175,37176,37178],false],[0,0,0,"id",null," Unique notification cookie for each filter.",null,false],[0,0,0,"pid",null," ID of the thread that triggered the notification.",null,false],[0,0,0,"flags",null," Bitmask for event information.

The simplest fix, in this case, would be to use defer like so:\n\n ```zig\n fn testImpl(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, length: usize) !void {\n     var foo = try allocator.alloc(u8, length);\n
